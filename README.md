# Interactive Visualizations of Bio-Numerical Equations

This repository contains a collection of self-contained, interactive web pages designed to visualize and explore various mathematical and biological models. Each HTML file provides a dynamic graph alongside sliders and controls, allowing users to manipulate parameters in real-time and observe the effects on the system.

The primary goal of this project is to create intuitive and engaging educational tools for students and educators in mathematics, biology, biochemistry, and calculus.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Fully Interactive:** Manipulate equation parameters with sliders and see instant updates to the plots.
* **Zero Dependencies:** No installation or build steps required. Just open the HTML files in any modern web browser.
* **Educational Focus:** Each visualization is centered around a key scientific or mathematical concept.
* **Beautiful Math:** Equations are rendered cleanly using MathJax for a professional look.
* **High-Quality Plotting:** All graphs are powered by the versatile JSXGraph library.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Using these visualizations is simple:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Taha1703/Visualizing-the-Dynamics-Graphs-of-Numerical-Equations.git](https://github.com/Taha1703/Visualizing-the-Dynamics-Graphs-of-Numerical-Equations.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Visualizing-the-Dynamics-Graphs-of-Numerical-Equations
    ```
3.  **Open any `.html` file** (e.g., `Michaelis_menten_fertig.html`) directly in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings to host them online for free.
